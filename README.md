### **Recommendation**
Given your need for a reliable radiation detector for lab work, the **GQ GMC-800** is the best choice. It offers high accuracy, multiple alarm types, and advanced features like data storage and analysis, which are crucial for a lab environment. While it is slightly more expensive, its compliance with national standards and user-friendly interface make it a worthwhile investment for your safety.

If you are looking for a more budget-friendly option, the **GQ GMC-300S** is a good alternative. It offers real-time data logging and PC software for analysis, though it lacks some of the advanced features of the GMC-800.

The **FNIRSI GC-01** is the most affordable option but may not meet the accuracy and functionality requirements for professional lab use. It is better suited for casual or beginner users.
